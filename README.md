# PolySort
PolySort is a smart, adaptive sorting algorithm. It first analyzes data patterns to dynamically select the most efficient sorting method (Quicksort, Radix, etc.). This hybrid approach maximizes speed by leveraging algorithm strengths and avoiding worst-case performance. Includes modular C and Python implementations.
